### Postmortem: Outage on E-commerce Website

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** June 5, 2024, 14:00 UTC - June 5, 2024, 16:30 UTC (2 hours 30 minutes)
- **Impact:** The main e-commerce website was down, preventing all users from browsing and purchasing products. Approximately 95% of users were affected.
- **Root Cause:** A misconfiguration in the load balancer settings caused a failure in traffic distribution, leading to server overload and a complete service outage.

### Timeline:

- **14:00 UTC:** Monitoring system alerts triggered due to increased error rates and slow response times.
- **14:05 UTC:** On-call engineer received alert and began initial investigation.
- **14:15 UTC:** Noticed high CPU and memory usage on web servers; assumed a possible DDoS attack.
- **14:20 UTC:** Traffic analysis showed no signs of malicious activity; escalated to network operations team.
- **14:30 UTC:** Network team investigated load balancer configurations.
- **14:45 UTC:** Misleading path: focused on firewall settings, but no issues found.
- **15:00 UTC:** Discovered recent changes in load balancer settings.
- **15:15 UTC:** Identified misconfiguration: incorrect routing rules leading to uneven load distribution.
- **15:30 UTC:** Began applying correct load balancer configuration.
- **16:00 UTC:** Configuration changes propagated; services began to recover.
- **16:30 UTC:** Full service restoration confirmed.

### Root Cause and Resolution:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings. During a recent update intended to optimize traffic handling, incorrect routing rules were applied. This misconfiguration caused the majority of incoming traffic to be directed to a subset of servers, overloading them and leading to server crashes and a complete outage of the service.

**Resolution:**
To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:
1. Identified and corrected the incorrect load balancer configuration.
2. Re-applied the correct routing rules to ensure even distribution of traffic across all servers.
3. Monitored the system closely to confirm that the changes took effect and that the service was fully restored.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures:

**Improvements and Fixes:**
1. **Configuration Management:** Implement stricter review and validation processes for changes in load balancer settings.
2. **Automated Testing:** Implement automated tests to validate load balancer configurations before applying them to production.
3. **Monitoring and Alerts:** Enhance monitoring to include checks specifically for load balancer performance and configuration accuracy.

**Tasks to Address the Issue:**
- [ ] Implement a peer-review system for all configuration changes.
- [ ] Develop automated tests for load balancer configuration validation.
- [ ] Add specific load balancer health checks to the monitoring system.
- [ ] Conduct training sessions for engineers on the importance of configuration management and best practices.
- [ ] Review and update incident response procedures to ensure quicker identification of similar issues in the future.

By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future and ensure a more resilient and reliable service for our users.
